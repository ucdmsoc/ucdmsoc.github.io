# ucdmsoc.github.io
This is a static website revolving around UCD's Malaysian Society. It not only informs but also helps build a sense of belonging among Malaysian students at UCD, making it a great resource for cultural connection and community engagement.​

Workload was divided as such:
- Anthony Petrosino: Developed the Home and Contact Us web pages. Also implemented mobile-friendly nav bar, footer with social media links and hosted website using github pages.
- Aqlan Ardy: Developed the About Us and Events pages. Embedded posts from instagram for an easy link to msocs social media page.
- Leigh Choy O’Byrne: Made the membership and resources page. Used the society’s email, an article from an alumni that was on the MSoc committee and the UCD student desk.
